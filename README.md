# Kaikanes-weather-dashboard
***
My site that displays the current and future weather forcast for citys. The user can look up a city and the site will show current and future (5days) conditions for that city. The search result will have basic information about the city like the city name, date, tempature, humidity, wind speed and cool icons for the weather! There is also a search history that keeps track of the citys the user searches for and when clicked will show the citys fore-cast again.
## Usage
***
For travelers to see weather conditions of multiple cities and use that knowledge to plan trips. (or just to quench curiosity!)
